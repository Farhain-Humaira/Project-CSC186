## Restaurant Reservation System

### Introduction
For this project, we have decided to create a system for restaurant reservation that would benefit customers and workers to simplify our day-to-day business besides it can save the time. This application is to develop a place where customers can book their seat and meal before come to the restaurant. 

The purpose of this application is to provide users easily their place at the restaurant within 
provided choice of seat, floor they want the seat be and cuisine. This application has the ability to potentially assist individuals to make a reservation from their gadgets and for the workers to be ready to complete the orders before customers being there. Usually people come to the restaurant without any idea for their seat and they need to wait a several minutes before their order to be serve. With this application, it will help both customers and workers to make everything become perfect.

Each customer will get discount whenever they use this application. If they set the reservation with 4 and above participant, they will get 10% discount. If they set the reservation below 4 participant, they only will get 5% discount for their cuisine and beverage. But if they just walk in and make order like normal, they wonâ€™t get any discount. So that, this will encourage people to use the application to save more and more in the future.

### Objectives
1.	To convey a systematic transaction process between customers and business to improving the efficiency of the application.
2.	To making things easier and save time for waiting.
3.	To provide the best customer service to the users and pull more future customers on this application.
